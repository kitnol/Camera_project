Guide on how to flash boards

1. Instaling esptool

Just write

pip install esptool

or

py -m pip install esptool

2. Instaling esp_idf_monitor

pip install esp_idf_monitor

or

py -m pip install esp_idf_monitor

3. You need to make sure that they are in boot mode

By specifics of current firmware on the chips you will need to disamble the casing and take out a board (I will make a video on how to do it)

Then you will need to hold a boot button (it is on a bottom righ from the chip) and while you holding it press reset button (it is on the left top)

Now you are in the boot mode

4. Prepare for uploading

!IMPORTANT!
Unzip archive with binary1 to some folder, there should be following folder structure:

YOUR_FOLDER
|--build
|  |--bootloader
|  |--partition_table

If it not, text me, most likely I messed up somewhere

5. Upload firmware

Fisrt in console navigate to "YOUR_FOLDER" where the build folder is stored

While camera disambeled connect it via USB cable to you computer and input following command

python -m esptool --chip esp32s3 -b 460800 --before default_reset --after hard_reset write_flash --flash_mode dio --flash_size 16MB --flash_freq 80m 0x0 build\bootloader\bootloader.bin 0x8000 build\partition_table\partition-table.bin 0x10000 build\console.bin

It should automitically identify port, especially if you do not have anything else connected
If not add -p "PORT_NAME" after esptool
Port you should be able to find in device maneger or similar (not sure about mac)

6. Post uploading process

Click a reset button (on the top left from the chip) again

7. Setting up camera

Start Serial communication by
py -m esp_idf_monitor

You will get some output and in the end will be
esp32> 

write command "login hello" (without quotes obiosly)
It needed bc, otherwise no comands gonna work

Then run following commands to set currrent time on RTC:

init_rtc
settime 2025 10 16 10 14

settime setting time on RTC options follows as <year> <month> <day> <hour> <minute>
if something not works, write "help" in terminal it will give you posible commands and it usage

Then write following command to check if time setted:

gettime

If everything is correct end monitoring by pressing "Ctrl + ]" or "Cmd + ]"

8. Unzip binary2 to different folder
Folder structure should be same as in step 4

9. Upload second binary follwing command:

python -m esptool --chip esp32s3 -b 460800 --before default_reset --after hard_reset write_flash --flash_mode dio --flash_size 16MB --flash_freq 80m 0x0 build\bootloader\bootloader.bin 0x8000 build\partition_table\partition-table.bin 0x10000 build\console.bin

10. Check if it works

Unplug camera and plug it back wait for 10-30 seconds, camera should apear as FLASH DRIVE and you should be able to open picture
If doing that, if you will have time, please charge them, just plug them to charge, it should be done in less then 2 hours, if you will not have time, just return cameras, and say to ARKadiusz and Casper to charge them
